How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
I try to write code that is readable, maintainable, and adaptable because it makes it easier for me and other developers to work with. When code is easy to read and understand, it saves time and reduces the risk of errors. I try to make my code maintainable by structuring it in a way that makes it easy to find and change specific parts of the code. This is especially important in the long term, as codebases often evolve and change over time. I also try to make my code adaptable, as it allows it to be used in a variety of different contexts and environments. This is especially useful when building software that is intended to be used by a wide range of users, as it allows the code to be more flexible and responsive to different needs.
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
When approaching a problem as a computer scientist, I try to break the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces. I begin by thoroughly understanding the requirements and constraints of the problem, and then I brainstorm potential solutions. I also consider any relevant best practices or industry standards that may apply. I then evaluate each potential solution based on its feasibility, efficiency, and scalability, and I choose the one that best meets the needs of the project. For the database and dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested, I took a similar approach. I first understood the specific requirements and constraints of the project, and then I brainstormed potential solutions. I considered the specific needs and goals of the project, as well as any relevant best practices or industry standards. I then evaluated each potential solution and selected the one that best met the needs of the project. In the future, I would use similar techniques and strategies to create databases to meet other client requests, including thoroughly understanding the requirements and constraints of the project, brainstorming potential solutions, and evaluating each solution based on its feasibility, efficiency, and scalability.
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
As a computer scientist, I specialize in developing software solutions that can help organizations like Grazioso Salvare to do their work more efficiently and effectively. In this particular project, I have been working on creating a database and web application dashboard that can help Grazioso Salvare to identify and categorize available dogs for search-and-rescue training. This is an important task for Grazioso Salvare, as they rely on having access to well-trained dogs to help rescue humans and animals in life-threatening situations.

My approach to this project has involved working closely with the client to understand their specific needs and requirements. I have also taken care to ensure that the database and dashboard I am developing are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, as these are all important qualities that will help Grazioso Salvare to use the software effectively in the future. I have used a CRUD Python module to connect the dashboard widgets to the database, which has provided a number of advantages, including the ability to easily update and modify the database as needed.
